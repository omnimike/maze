# Maze (better name TBD)
An ASCII art maze runner game.
This is a small project to get started with Elm and Haskell. It's still a work in progress.

## Status

Currently the Elm frontend allows movement around the maze using the h, j, k and l keys.
The Haskell backend server can generate complex mazes for the client.
However, they haven't been wired together so you can play the mazes generated by the server.
